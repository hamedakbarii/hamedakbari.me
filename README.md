- **`config/*`** - Includes all the custom configuration for [contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- **`content/*`** - MDX blog posts and the content for the `about` and `donate` pages
- **`public/*`** - Static assets including images, fonts, audios, files, etc.
- **`scripts/*`** - Utilities to setup the project
- **`src/app/*`** - Every page and api route in the website. Uses the new [App Router](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/getting-started#introducing-the-app-router) from [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) `13.+`
- **`src/assets/*`** - Fonts and static images used in different components
- **`src/components/core/*`** - The simplest components. Most of them are stateless
- **`src/components/icons/*`** - SVG icon paths. Icons come from [Material Design Icons](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/) [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/)
- **`src/components/molecules/*`** - The main blocks for the website: `toolbar`, `footer`, `main` layout, `back-to-top` button and `social links`
- **`src/components/og/*`** - The code that powers dynamic open-graph images generation
- **`src/components/views/*`** - More complex components to build the different pages of my website. _(They're here to keep `src/app/` as clean as possible)_
- **`src/data/*`** - JSON files containing data for projects and the [`uses`](https://hiradary.me/uses) page
- **`src/hooks/*`** - A couple hooks used throughout the app
- **`src/lib/*`** - Short for "library", a collection of helpful utilities or code for external services
- **`src/providers/*`** - React Contexts for storing the current theme and blog post reactions
- **`src/styles/*`** - Global styles with `scss`. Mostly use tailwind classes
- **`src/types/*`** - Some types definitions
- **`src/utils/*`** - More utilities functions but less complex than the ones in `lib`

## Cloning / Forking

Please review the [license](https://github.com/jahirfiquitiva/hamedakbari-me.vercel.app/blob/main/LICENSE), do not copy it directly, remove all of my personal content and files (resume, blog posts, images, etc.) by running `yarn setup` and please change the styling and colors to match your personal brand. You are free to use this code as inspiration or learning reference but this is not really intended to be a template.
