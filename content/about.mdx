ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! This is **Hamed Akbari**. I'm a front-end developer based in Tehran ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡· with over 3 years of professional experience.

I pay close attention to details and am deeply committed to creating software products that are visually appealing, user-friendly, and simple to maintain.

I'm a big fan of open source and have shared a lot of my work, including websites on GitHub.

I'm an initiative-taking and flexible professional who thrives in global remote teams that prioritize people and uphold values such as trust, kindness, and inclusivity. I'm constantly seeking challenges that allow me to enhance and broaden my skills. This is the reason I engage in side projects during my free time and contribute to open source whenever feasible.
